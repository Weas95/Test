                            minecraft.
                            But CSGO is a very close runner up, I have spent a significant portion of my life playing
                            and watching this game. Multiple of my friends I've met through this game.

                            freaking 568 hours. It's a pretty good game that's free to play ! It gets very grindy though
                            you have to put a lot of hours into it to get modern vehicles. That's not really a big issue
                            for me as I just really play it mainly for the ww2 era vehicles. it's pretty fun

                            Haven't played it in ages though. It was fun when it first came out but now it's just
                            collecting dust in my virtual library. This game was quite fun back when I wasn't sick of

                            complete without it. Well this list will never be complete as this is just me trying out
                            shit, but that's beside the point. Great game to make friends with, really easy game to get
                            into but extremely hard to master. I can honestly say it's one of the only esport games that
                            I like to watch other than CSGO. Big fan. not a big fan of them going to epic though.
